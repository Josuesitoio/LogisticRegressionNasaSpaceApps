Exoplanets 3D
Overview
Exoplanets 3D is an interactive web application designed for the visualization and exploration of exoplanets. This project was developed as part of the International NASA Space Apps Challenge with the goal of making complex astronomical data accessible and engaging for the general public. The interface allows users to navigate the known universe, discover new worlds, and learn about the conditions that could support life.

Key Features
The application is divided into four key sections to guide the user on their cosmic exploration:

Explore:

Offers an interactive catalog of discovered exoplanets.

Allows users to visualize representations of these distant worlds in a 3D environment, providing a unique perspective on their potential appearance.

Habitability:

Educates users on the factors that determine if a planet is potentially habitable, such as its distance from the host star (the "habitable zone").

Presents a selection of exoplanets that are the most promising candidates for harboring life.

Search:

Provides advanced filtering tools for users to search for specific exoplanets.

The filters are based on real scientific data, such as the planet's size, mass, the type of star it orbits, and the discovery method.

Decoded:

Simply explains the technologies and methods that astronomers use to detect exoplanets, such as the transit method and radial velocity.

This section aims to demystify the discovery process and bring science closer to the users.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the fundamental structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: For a modern, responsive, and customizable user interface design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive logic and DOM manipulation.

Three.js: The core of the visual experience, used to render the dynamic space background, the procedurally generated nebula, and future 3D planet visualizations.

Python: Used for processing and analysis of exoplanet datasets. Python scripts handle the cleaning, filtering, and preparation of data for use in the application.

.pkl Files: Python pickle files used to store pre-processed data objects, such as machine learning models or clean dataframes, allowing for fast and efficient loading in the application or backend.

This project combines a visually stunning design with scientific data to create an educational and fascinating tool for exploring worlds beyond our solar system.
